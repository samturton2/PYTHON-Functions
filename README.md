# Functions
## How to create a function
## Functions and there abilities

**DRY - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF**

- Functions will help us implement DRY

- `return` key-word means the function will output that value when printed
- can store variables before printing them aswell using returns
- some examples
```python
def subtract(num1, num2):
# creating a subtract function that takes 2 args
    print(num1 - num2)

subtract(3, 2)

def remainder(num1, num2):
# returns the remainder when num1 is divided by num2
    return num1 % num2

remainder_value = remainder(7, 4)
print(remainder_value)
```
# Best Practise
- Best practise is to have a small block of code in any function that does one job.
- Pseudo coding - one line of explanation
- HINTs: create hints in simple bullet points or pointers
- comments regarding you function results
